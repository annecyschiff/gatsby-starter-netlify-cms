**User 1:** Grace is an international student who cannot work on her visa.  Because she can't have an income in New Zealand she can't really get into a lot of the different outdoor sports here she is keen to try, besides surfing which she is already good at and bought a board for.  She has learned to mountain bike on a friends bike but wants to be able to go out with the friend so she needs her own bike.  However, she can't rent a bike anywhere.  So, she looks up renting options and finds Gearshare.  She browses bikes in the area that people are willing to rent out and and finds a good deal.  Additionally, Grace is an avid surfer and is eventually able to simply swap gear and exchange lessons on their sports with the mountain bike renter instead of renting.  



**User 2:**  Zane is a beginner surfer.  He has been learning a couple times on Unipol boards and is hooked.  He finally knows he wants to commit to being a surfer.  However, he isn't sure what kind of board he wants.  He progressed pretty quickly but isn't sure if he should stick with a higher volume board since he is still pretty new at it or if he should go right to a shortboard.  He checked with every surf store in the area but none are willing to rent nice boards.  One day, he hears about Gearshare.  A couple of his friends know people who rent out different style boards on the website.  Zane checks out the about page and thinks the service is a great option for him.  He browses products and finds all kinds of boards of all shapes and sizes.  He messages a couple different boards owners and takes their boards out throughout the week.  He made a deposit on all the rentals and makes sure he returns them all on time so he gets his deposit back.
