Gearshare is a service that allows adventurers to maximize their gear’s use and explore the outdoor gear, and the fellow adventurers, in their community.   Gearshare allows users to profit off of gear they already own by renting it out. Those surfboards you only take out occasionally or that old pair of flippers that are collecting dust in your basement… they can get more use, and benefit you through gearshare renting. And, if you are keen to try out a sport but aren’t ready to invest in purchasing your own gear yet, renting is the perfect option to test things out. Gearshare opens up a diverse selection of equipment which would not otherwise be available to renters.  

Gearshare also allows you to connect with fellow adventurers who can teach you their craft as you teach them yours. gearshare has a community building aspect on our website; users can post “ads” offering their knowledge on their \[area of expertise?] sport in exchange for lessons from a fellow adventurer on a different sport. This aspect of the site allows for even greater community building.

Additionally gearshare works on cultivating community for outdoors lovers in your towns by installing community gearboxes which hold a variety of items that can be provided by the community, maintained by the community, and shared by the community.  Community codes to the gearbox allow security for the items while fundraising and use of the gear helps communities bond.  Gearboxes can also be a place for families to put old gear they no longer want to use but still has life in it such as old winter jackets.  



Overall, gearshare harnesses the skills and strength of individuals in an area to strengthen community there and improve access to outdoor adventure and reduce redundancy and waste in outdoor products. Gearshare streamlines the invaluable benefits of achieving a sustainable, connected, efficient outdoor community.  

So, go ahead and rummage through your garage for that long-lost pile of gear and chuck it on the website.  Join gearshare and browse the wealth of knowledge, gear, and friends your community has to offer.  In sharing yourself and your passion with others you will find a whole world of adventures right at your fingertips.  In sharing, we are all stronger.  Join Gearshare today!
