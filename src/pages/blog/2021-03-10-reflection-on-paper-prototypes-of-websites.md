I went over my paper prototype today with my three users.  As a reminder, the following are my three users:

\- Eugene: looking to make some money off his climbing gear by putting it on the Gearshare for rent.  

\- Chloe: looking to try a bunch of different outdoor sports on a budget without having to commit to buying her own gear for each sport.  She is looking to rent or do a Gearshare swap with her backpacking pack.  

\- Kane: Kane is looking to find a buddy to climb with.  He wants to use the socializer page of the website and maybe get a surf lesson out of it in exchange for him teaching climbing.  

Using the paper prototypes proved more complicated than they may seem but were overall really fun and incredibly useful for thinking through the journey of my website for different users.  I tried to think through every aspect and scenario and the related webpage as thoroughly as I could but watching users engage with the prototype exposed a lot of flaws to me and gave me very valuable insight.  For example, when Eugene went through the process of trying to add items to rent, I realized I didn't plan out what it would look like for him to be notified and receive information on people who have requested to rent from him.  

Overall, I really loved this process and how helpful it was.  It was also really fun to see people get excited about the idea and have fun with the paper prototyping.  

Here are the links to videos of users using the paper prototype:

\- notice the piece missing at the end here-I realized I should have planned pages for him receiving a message from a renter.
