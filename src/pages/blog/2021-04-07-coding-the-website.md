Making the website has been a challenge because I haven't done html or css coding before.  But, it has been really rewarding to see it eventually come together.  While it has been a difficult process, learning the language of these coding systems has been really interesting.  It was cool to see my understanding of web coding grow throughout the process.  I began to recognize more problems on my own and was able to problem solve more by myself.  Although, I did consistently have to ask lots of questions and I appreciate Martin and my classmates helping me out a lot.  The most useful method of learning for me was using the inspect tool to pinpoint what piece of code I was dealing with.  While the experience overall could be frustrating at times, it was really cool and interesting to see the ins and outs of website coding!
