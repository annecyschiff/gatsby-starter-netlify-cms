My moodboard features action shots of people doing outdoor sports.  It highlights people having fun with all different sorts of gear.  It also features textures like contour lines from topographical maps.  My color scheme will feature a bold red/orange color that carries feelings of excitement, action, and adrenaline.  My typography is a bold and simple style.  

On my second approach to moodboards I ended up making two.  One is slightly more whimsical and artistic while the other has a more aggressive, corporate vibe.  I think I will end up blending the aesthetic of the first mood board with its relaxed colors and the modernity of the second mood board with its simplicity.  

The first mood board has the following attributes: 

muted, relaxed, earthy color schemes

whimsical, nostalgic vibes 

Typography reminiscent of vintage national parks posters

The second moodboard has the following attributes:

brighter, more aggressive color scheme

aggressive, action-packed, more corporate vibe

more distinct, clear, vivid imagery rather than mystical looking dreamy imagery

Ultimately, I plan to keep the color scheme of moodboard 1 with its inviting, relaxed tones and use the simplicity of moodboard 2.
