I didn't have time to incorporate all of the feedback from the presentation so I am recording it here for future reference.  The viewers said they wanted to see more of the national parks influence from my moodboard in the website.  Things like the topographical lines would be great.  I would have loved to add these elements of texture in but I am not quite competent enough with html and css to do so.  

They also said some things could be tweaked.  The search bar spacing is a bit off in some places and the formatting of words could also be adjusted a bit.  Additionally, the header font could be a bit clearer and the banner images could be more in theme or should all have words over them.  

They liked how I incorporated user testing.  I had a much more complex plan for the number of pages and renting process and through user testing saw that I should simplify it to be an easier process for users.

I also had issues with responsiveness on some of the pages in mobile view.  I couldn't figure out how to fix them unfortunately.



I managed to fix the search bar and the banner image on the about page.  I put text heading of the about page over the banner image like Adon recommended.  I also made the text at the top of the about page in a thinner container like they said.  I changed the header font to poppins because it is a bit clearer.
