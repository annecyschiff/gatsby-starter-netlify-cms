I worked on some wireframes for the gear profiles over the weekend.  I tried to keep the page pretty simple so that viewers are drawn to the image of the products and the information about it.  Too many colors would be distracting I think.  Also, instead of having a booking form on the website, the renters can e-mail the address or text the number mentioned in the description and can coordinate logistics fo the rental in this way.  I think I may choose a different body text font because it is too similar to the subheading font.
